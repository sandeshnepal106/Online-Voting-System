# Online-Voting-System
This project mainly focuses on developing an Online Voting System. For this project we are choosing platforms like: HTML, CSS, JavaScript, PHP, MySQL, etc.

The main features of this project would be to: 
    1. Enable a user register and login. 
    2. Allow users to cast their votes. 
    3. Display the results of the election. 
    4. Make user profiles accessible. 
    5. User can add or delete polls and comments. 
    6. A real-time result and secured votes.

To make the project more modular, it is divided into phases: 
    1. Login/Register logic, Poll creation, Voting, Result Display
    2. User Niches/interests, Poll tags, etc.
    3. User profile, Post deletion, etc.
    4. Edit profile, Comments, replies, delete posts, comments, etc.

With attention to the fact that further ideas may appear or be suggested, the phases might be modified/increased/decreased or be altered in any other way.
